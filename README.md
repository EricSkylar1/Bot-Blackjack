# Bot-Blackjack
Bot Blackjack is a simple JavaScript simulation of the classic card game where two bots play against each other. It features core Blackjack logic, bot decision-making, and a turn-based system. Built with clean, vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates game flow, randomness, and AI behavior in a lightweight environment.
